    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>Learn Enough to be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
        <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take 
        command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
        everything from commnad lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
        Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
        We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people </strong>who can benefit from 
        learning technical sophistication, problably more. To join our
        movement,

    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
        HTML was created by the originnal "web developer", computer scientist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-lee">Tim 
            Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
            share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

            In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
            Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
        </p>
        <blockquote style="margin: 0 20px auto;padding: 20px;background-color: #f6f5f5;">
            <p>
                <em>Dont believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
                <br>
                -Abraham Lincoln
            </p>
