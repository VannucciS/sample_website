        <p>The <a href="https://www.Softcover.io">Softcover</a> publishing plataform
            was designed mainly for ebooks like the <a href="https://www.Softcover.io">Ruby on rails tutorial 
            book</a> and <a href="https://www.Softcover.io"> Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</a>, but it' 
            also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em>
             Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below
             a short and affectionately irreverent bok report on this clasic of 
            American literatura.

            target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
            by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money 
                in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little 
                and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating 
                the circulation.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
            Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately on
            jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who - <em>spoiler 
            alert!</em>- is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
